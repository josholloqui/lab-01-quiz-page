            <p class="dense-info">
                I'm glad you asked! I am as you can see a dog, but I like to think of myself as a pupper.
                 Also, to be more specific I am a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. 
                 Yes I understand that it's a mouth full, so that's why I'm just Finn &#128054;. Oh
                 by the way pay close attention there might be a quiz at the end...

            <h2>This is me!</h2>
            <p class="dense-info">Hello once again! Let me tell you some more about myself! 
                I apologize for all the yelling I just get really excited like all the time. 
                Which is funny because I also love sleeping and taking numerous naps throughout the day. 
                I think that why my owners Josh and Kayla love so much. Plus like look at me I know I'm adorable, 
                and I'm not going to lie I definitley use that agaist my owners when I get in trouble. Muahaha. 
                Which reminds I hate it when my owners give me a bath, because they do not realize that I've been 
                spending all this time since my last bath trying to regain my fabulous scent I love. 
                I guess it makes them happy when I smell "clean", so it okay I guess. Speaking of things 
                I dislike I also dislike when my owners leave without taking me with them... Even though 
                it might just be for 10 minutes, but they don't realize that it's an enternity for me in dog time. 
                I love them though they're my favorite humans ever they give me food, treats, toys, cuddles, love, 
                puppicinos, and let me watch all the animal documentaries I want!

            <h2>My Friends!</h2>
            <p class="dense-info">I wanted to spend sometime talking about my amazing puuper friends that I have! 
                The first pupper friend I want to talk about is Bennie she is a Border Collie. Bennie and I 
                love to play together chasing each other around and fighting over toys. Another pupper friend I have 
                is KoKo she is a Dachshund she is suprisingly smaller than I am. I like to consider KoKo my girlfriend 
                but I don't know if she considers me her boyfriend. I think so since we enjoy cuddling together. Oh! I forgot 
                to mention that we also live together in the same house, so i get to see them all the time! It's amazing.
